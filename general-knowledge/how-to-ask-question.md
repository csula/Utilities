# How to ask a technical question?

For you students out there in the Computer Science class, I (Eric) has some
preference on how you ask questions to instructor (me).

All in all, I prefer you to do some initial research and being assertive on
your assumptions before asking questions to me.

Note that this is not to discourage any of you from asking questions but to ensure
the quality of questions. In other word, this is to ensure students putting their initial effort for better learning experience.

So here is the format:

1. Before you ask any question, ask yourself:

  * What is your expectation?
  * What is wrong (different) than your expectation?
  * Have you Googled online on situation (error message for example)?

2. Once you are able to answer yourself for above 3 questions. Have you triple
confirmed that your expectation is correct according to theory?

3. Now you may ask the question with statement on your expectations, errors and
even your initial research!

If you have some initial researches down yourself, it's easier for the other side
of the table to answer your question! That other side of table could even be your
classmates or myself as instructor.

Again, this note is not to discourage any of you from asking questions! It's to
ensure the questions are high quality and easier for other to answer your question.

If you have any thought or notes on my general suggestions on how you should ask
questions, I'd love to hear from you. Please open an issue to start discussion.
